## Code

Here we have all the code associated with the data wrangling.

## Folder structure

Scripts are separated by their main function:

```{r list_r_files}
r_files <- list.files(path = "~/WGOA-Ecopath-Rpath/code", pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = FALSE)

cat(paste0("- ", r_files, collapse = "
"))
```

-   AKFIN:

    ```         
    akfin_to_EwE_format_v2.R 
    ```
