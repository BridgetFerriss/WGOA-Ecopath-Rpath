## Code

Here we have all the code associated with the data wrangling.

## Folder structure

Scripts are separated by their main function:

```{r list_r_files}
r_files <- list.files(path = "~/WGOA-Ecopath-Rpath/code", pattern = "\\.R$", 
                      full.names = FALSE)

cat(paste0("- ", r_files, collapse = "
"))
```

-   **AKFIN**:

    -   `akfin_wgoa_catch_2023.R`: This script retrieves and processes catch data from the AKFIN database for the WGOA region.

    -   `akfin_to_EwE_format_v2.R`: This script transforms the data retrieved from `akfin_wgoa_catch_2023.R` into a format suitable for Rpath.
